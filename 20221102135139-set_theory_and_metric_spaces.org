* Chapter 1
** 1.1
*** Exercise 1

A set $A$ has the promperty than $A \subset B$ holds for any set $B$. Prove that $A = \varnothing$.

\begin{proof}
\forall B. A \subset B \\
Let B = \varnothing, \\
A \subset \varnothing \\
\text{therefore A contains nothing, therefore A = \varnothing.}
\end{proof}
*** Exercise 2

Let A, B, C be sets satisfying $A \subset B, B \subset C, C \subset A$. Prove that $A = B = C$.

Transitivity:
$$ A \subset B \subset C \subset A $$
$$ B \subset C \subset A \subset B $$
$$ C \subset A \subset B \subset C $$

*** Exercise 3

How many elements are there in the following sets?
\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
|\varnothing| = 0 \\
|\{\varnothing\}| = 1 \\
|\{\{\varnothing\}\}| = 1 \\
|\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}| = 2 \\
|\{\varnothing,\varnothing\}| = 2
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
*** Exercise 4
$$C \subset A \subset (B = D)$$
*** Exercise 5
$(A = D) \subset B$
$(A = D) \subset C$
*** Exercise 6
$$| P(\{1,2\}) = \{ \varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}\} | = 4 = 2^2$$
*** Exercise 7
$$| P(\{1,2,3\}) = \{ varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\} | | = 8 = 2^3$$
*** Exercise 8
The powerset of an N-element set can be mapped directly onto an N-digit binary number.
